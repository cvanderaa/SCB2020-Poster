  abstract = "The fate and physiology of individual cells are controlled by
              proteins. Yet, our ability to quantitatively analyze proteins in
              single cells has remained limited. To overcome this barrier, we
              developed SCoPE2. It substantially increases quantitative
              accuracy and throughput while lowering cost and hands-on time by
              introducing automated and miniaturized sample preparation. These
              advances enabled us to analyze the emergence of cellular
              heterogeneity as homogeneous monocytes differentiated into
              macrophage-like cells in the absence of polarizing cytokines.
              SCoPE2 quantified over 3,042 proteins in 1,490 single monocytes
              and macrophages in ten days of instrument time, and the
              quantified proteins allowed us to discern single cells by cell
              type. Furthermore, the data uncovered a continuous gradient of
              proteome states for the macrophage-like cells, suggesting that
              macrophage heterogeneity may emerge even in the absence of
              polarizing cytokines. Parallel measurements of transcripts by 10x
              Genomics scRNA-seq suggest that our measurements sampled 20-fold
              more protein copies than RNA copies per gene, and thus SCoPE2
              supports quantification with improved count statistics. Joint
              analysis of the data illustrates how variability across single
              cells can reveal transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene
              regulation. Our methodology lays the foundation for automated and
              quantitative single-cell analysis of proteins by
              mass-spectrometry. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The

  abstract = "Hearing and balance rely on small sensory hair cells that reside
              in the inner ear. To explore dynamic changes in the abundant
              proteins present in differentiating hair cells, we used
              nanoliter-scale shotgun mass spectrometry of single cells, each
              ~1 picoliter, from utricles of embryonic day 15 chickens. We
              identified unique constellations of proteins or protein groups
              from presumptive hair cells and from progenitor cells. The
              single-cell proteomes enabled the de novo reconstruction of a
              developmental trajectory using protein expression levels,
              revealing proteins that greatly increased in expression during
              differentiation of hair cells (e.g., OCM, CRABP1, GPX2, AK1,
              GSTO1) and those that decreased during differentiation (e.g.,
              TMSB4X, AGR3). Complementary single-cell transcriptome profiling
              showed corresponding changes in mRNA during maturation of hair
              cells. Single-cell proteomics data thus can be mined to reveal
              features of cellular development that may be missed with
              transcriptomics.",
